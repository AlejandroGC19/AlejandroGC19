### Hi everyone, I'm Alejandro 😏👋

### About me 🧑
- I am a 26-year-old software engineer with almost two years of experience in Matlab development. I am a passionate about computing world, in constant self-learning and/or taking courses on current topics to improve my professional skills. 🙌


### Current job 👨‍💼
- I’m currently working as industrial engineer, but I would like to work as sotfware or front-end developer. For this reason, I'm already learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React (for now, when I start working as front end developer, I would like to start learning about backend scope). 

### Experience 👨‍💻
- I worked for almost 2 years in the University of Huelva in a European project called KTTSeaDrones as software engineer and researcher. In this time, I used MATLAB (functional programming) to generate autonomy for a Remote Operated Vehicle. In this way, I have managed to create algorithms that allow the ROV to recognize its environment through the data of a SONAR (using clustering and data processing), representing them in a HMI, quantifying fish in real time and creating autonomy through an automatic control code.

- 🦾 In addittion, during my time in university, I created some algorithms related to MATLAB for a hybrid hexapod robot (in the same way as ROVs) and Arduino.
