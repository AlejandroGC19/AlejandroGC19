<h1> Hello world! I'm Alejandro 😏👋 </h1>

<h3> About me 🧑 </h3>

- I have been working as an industrial engineer managing teams for more than two years, but I would like to go back to work as a software developer like in my research period at university, because I feel that this branch of technology brings out the best of my skills. For this reason, I have taken several courses to learn the most demanded software as a full-stack developer in the industry (HTML, CSS, JS, React, Python, Git, Node, Jest, SQL, JWT) in order to pursue my career path in this field.

- At the beginning of my professional career, I worked as a software engineer for two years researching the development of a water vehicle in Matlab. I am passionate about the world of computer science, constantly self-learning and taking courses on current topics to improve my professional skills. 🙌

<h3> Experience as developer 👨‍💻 </h3>

- I worked for almost 2 years in the University of Huelva in a European project called KTTSeaDrones as software engineer and researcher. In this time, I used MATLAB (functional programming) to generate autonomy for a Remote Operated Vehicle. In this way, I have managed to create algorithms that allow the ROV to recognize its environment through the data of a SONAR (using clustering and data processing), representing them in a HMI, quantifying fish in real time and creating autonomy through an automatic control code.

- 🦾 In addittion, during my time in the university, I created some algorithms related to a hybrid hexapod robot (in the same way as ROVs) in Matlab and Arduino. Also, I performed an HMI with Arduino in a touch screen, using real time processes and interactions.
