### About me
I am a 26-year-old software engineer with almost two years of experience in Matlab development. I am a passionate about computing world, in constant self-learning and/or taking courses on current topics to improve my professional skills.

### Current job
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as industrial engineer, but I would like to work as sotfware or front-end developer.

### Experience
- I worked for almost 2 years in a European project called KTTSeaDrones as software engineer and researcher. In this time, I used MATLAB to develop automatic control in a Remote Operated Vehicle, in addittion to the use of clustering with SONAR data for environment recognization. 

During my time in university, I created some algorithms related to MATLAB (Hybrid hexapod robot) and Arduino.

I currently work in the industrial field, but I would love to return to the developing scope. So, I'm learning on my own web development, starting to create my first projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
