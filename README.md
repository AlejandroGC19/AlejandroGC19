## About me
Hello everyone! I'm Alejandro, an industrial engineer who worked for almost 2 years in a European project called KTTSeaDrones as software engineer and researcher. In this time, I used MATLAB to develop automatic control in a Remote Operated Vehicle, in addittion to the use of clustering with SONAR data for environment recognization. 

During my time in university, I created some algorithms related to MATLAB (Hybrid hexapod robot) and Arduino.

I currently work in the industrial field, but I would love to return to the world of software. So, I'm learning on my own web development, starting to create my first projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
